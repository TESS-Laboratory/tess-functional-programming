This repo offers a super basic example of how you can set up an R project for
functional programming - this is what Hugh generated during the TESS weekly 
meeting. 

The `workflow.R` file contains the function calls but all functions are contained
in the `/R` directory. To run this project simply clone this repo, install the
packages that are in `/packages.R`and run the `workflow.R` script.

For more information on functional programming and all it's awesome benefits, 
I strongly suggest you check out these book chapters: 

https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html
https://raps-with-r.dev/fprog.html

This page now also includes a minimal [{targets}](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) example. {targets} is an amazing package for managing complex and/or long running workflows, helping to 
ensure reproducibility and data integrity.
